Test Output
  


  Swetest computes a complete set of geocentric planetary positions,
  for a given date or a sequence of dates.
  Input can either be a date or an absolute julian day number.
  0:00 (midnight).
  With the proper options, swetest can be used to output a printed
  ephemeris and transfer the data into other programs like spreadsheets
  for graphical display.
  Version: 2.10.03
  Command line options:
     help commands:
        -?, -h  display whole info
        -hcmd   display commands
        -hplan  display planet numbers
        -hform  display format characters
        -hdate  display input date format
        -hexamp  display examples
        -glp  report file location of library



     input time formats:
        -bDATE  begin date; e.g. -b1.1.1992 if
                Note: the date format is day month year (European style).
        -bj...  begin date as an absolute Julian day number; e.g. -bj2415020.5
        -j...   same as -bj
        -tHH[:MM[:SS]]  input time (as Ephemeris Time)
        -ut     input date is Universal Time (UT1)
	-utHH[:MM[:SS]] input time (as Universal Time)
	-utcHH[:MM[:SS]] input time (as Universal Time Coordinated UTC)
		H,M,S can have one or two digits. Their limits are unchecked.


     output time for eclipses, occultations, risings/settings is UT by default
        -lmt    output date/time is LMT (with -geopos)
        -lat    output date/time is LAT (with -geopos)

     object, number of steps, step with

        -pSEQ   planet sequence to be computed.
                See the letter coding below.

        -dX     differential ephemeris: print differential ephemeris between
                body X and each body in list given by -p
                example: -p2 -d0 -fJl -n366 -b1.1.1992 prints the longitude
                distance between SUN (planet 0) and MERCURY (planet 2)
                for a full year starting at 1 Jan 1992.

        -dhX    differential ephemeris: print differential ephemeris between
                heliocentric body X and each body in list given by -p
                example: -p8 -dh8 -ftl -n36600 -b1.1.1500 -s5 prints the longitude
                distance between geocentric and heliocentric Neptune (planet 8)
                for 500 year starting at 1 Jan 1500.
		Using this option mostly makes sense for a single planet
		to find out how much its geocentric and heliocentric positions can differ
		over extended periods of time

	-DX	midpoint ephemeris, works the same way as the differential
		mode -d described above, but outputs the midpoint position.

        -nN     output data for N consecutive timesteps; if no -n option
                is given, the default is 1. If the option -n without a
                number is given, the default is 20.

        -sN     timestep N days, default 1. This option is only meaningful
                when combined with option -n.
                If an 'y' is appended, the time step is in years instead of days, 
                for example -s10y for a time step of 10 years.
                If an 'mo' is appended, the time step is in months instead of days, 
                for example -s3mo for a time step of 3 months.
                If an 'm' is appended, the time step is in minutes instead of days, 
                for example -s15m for a time step of 15 minutes.
                If an 's' is appended, the time step is in seconds instead of days, 
                for example -s1s for a time step of 1 second.

     output format:

        -fSEQ   use SEQ as format sequence for the output columns;
                default is PLBRS.
        -head   don't print the header before the planet data. This option
                is useful when you want to paste the output into a
                spreadsheet for displaying graphical ephemeris.
        +head   header before every step (with -s..) 
        -gPPP   use PPP as gap between output columns; default is a single
                blank.  -g followed by white space sets the
                gap to the TAB character; which is useful for data entry
                into spreadsheets.
        -hor	list data for multiple planets 'horizontally' in same line.
		all columns of -fSEQ are repeated except time colums tTJyY.

     astrological house system:

        -house[long,lat,hsys]	

		include house cusps. The longitude, latitude (degrees with
		DECIMAL fraction) and house system letter can be given, with
		commas separated, + for east and north. If none are given,
		Greenwich UK and Placidus is used: 0.00,51.50,p.
		The output lists 12 house cusps, Asc, MC, ARMC, Vertex,
		Equatorial Ascendant, co-Ascendant as defined by Walter Koch, 
		co-Ascendant as defined by Michael Munkasey, and Polar Ascendant. 
		Houses can only be computed if option -ut is given.

  In the standard setting five columns of coordinates are printed with
  the default format PLBRS. You can change the default by providing an
  option like -fCCCC where CCCC is your sequence of columns.
  The coding of the sequence is like this:

  Date entry:

  In the interactive mode, when you are asked for a start date,
  you can enter data in one of the following formats:

        1.2.1991        three integers separated by a nondigit character for
                        day month year. Dates are interpreted as Gregorian
                        after 4.10.1582 and as Julian Calendar before.
                        Time is always set to midnight (0 h).
                        If the three letters jul are appended to the date,
                        the Julian calendar is used even after 1582.
                        If the four letters greg are appended to the date,
                        the Gregorian calendar is used even before 1582.

        j2400123.67     the letter j followed by a real number, for
                        the absolute Julian daynumber of the start date.
                        Fraction .5 indicates midnight, fraction .0
                        indicates noon, other times of the day can be
                        chosen accordingly.

                repeat the last entry
        
        .               stop the program

        +20             advance the date by 20 days

        -10             go back in time 10 days
