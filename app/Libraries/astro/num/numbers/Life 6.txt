The �6� Life Path: The Nurturer
When I was a child, my mother said to me, �If you become a soldier,
you�ll be a general. If you become a monk, you�ll end up as the pope.�
Instead, I became a painter and wound up as Picasso.

The 6 Life Path is the natural parent, viewing others from a paternal or maternal
point of view. A 6 Life Path goes along with love and marriage like the proverbial
�horse and carriage.�
There is a nurturing quality to the 6. If the 6 can�t have children, chances are
they�ll teach schoolchildren�or run a big business and treat their employees like
children! If a 6 Life Path woman divorces, she often throws herself into the lives of
her children and has difficulty ever seeing them as grownups. In her mind, her son or
daughter will be a child forever. Of course, now and again I�ll meet a 6 man who says
he has no desire for children. When I hear this, I automatically ask him if he has any
pets. That�s when he�ll light up like a proud parent, and tell me all about his cat, dog,
horse, etc. So I suggest to you 6s out there who aren�t going to be the parent of a child
to find a pet to love, hold, and hug. You won�t believe the difference it will make in
your life.
In terms of romantic relationships, it comes as no surprise that 6 women,
especially those who don�t have children of their own, tend to attract men who act like
little boys. The 6 man, on the other hand, attracts women who are damsels in distress.
But even above marriage, domestic tranquility is paramount to the 6. If they are with a
partner who displays anger or generally causes a lot of unpleasantness�especially
around the children�they usually decide they�d rather be alone than keep that partner
around.
A 6 Life Path must find ways to use their creative energies. Art, music, and poetry
are natural avenues to take. If 6s don�t keep busy, they can get caught up in petty things
�such as gossiping and redecorating the home over and over again�just because
they�re bored. Because 6s so believe in a strong family unit, if happily married, they
would rather spend time with their partners than with friends.
If the 6 has not made the choice to have a family, then the workplace is the home,
and his employees and coworkers become the family. The 6 Life Path will provide the
same kind of nurturing presence at the office or in a home environment.
These are magnetic people. They tend to be physically attractive, but it�s more
45
than that�there�s a force about them that�s hard to ignore. The 6 needs to manage or
own their own company. They find it hard to work for other people.
Thoughts and words are powerful for all Life Paths, but they can be especially
problematic for the 6. As someone who is predisposed to be a parent, a 6 is concerned
with making sure the future is going to be taken care of. Often, this means a 6 woman
will assure herself that, if necessary, she would be able to make it on her own. When a
married woman starts to say this to herself, the next thing you know she�s divorced.
And yes, she can take care of business and make it, but she�s suddenly alone when she
didn�t need to be. Thoughts are very powerful and will attract whatever we believe
we are going to get, so I tell 6s not to say this kind of thing. As Job lamented in the
Bible: �The thing I greatly feared has come upon me.�
This is something I see over and over. One 6 client told me that every man she had
been involved with had cheated on her. Well, just in knowing she thought about this
regularly, I knew she was attracting men who would cheat on her. It wasn�t something
she was choosing consciously, but it was a direct result of having this limited belief.
The 6 needs harmony. Unfortunately, they often forget that they must deal with their
own unhappiness before they try to fix life for others. When the 6 is in trouble, they
just need to speak up and say what they�re feeling when they�re feeling it.
The 6�s home is everything. They are the natural interior decorators, and like to
rearrange their homes and make them just right. If they are ever in a position where
they have to live in somebody else�s house, they are unfulfilled.
In my observations of 6 vibration women, time and again their keen sense of smell
comes up in conversation. Oftentimes they can�t wear perfume because it�s
overwhelming to them. They tend to be particular about the scents and lotions they use
and those used by the people around them. If someone is smoking in a building, the 6
can smell it across the hall. One client who took a daily fitness walk on a certain street
noticed an unbearable odor. It got to the point where she had to change her route to
avoid the general area. Two months later the police discovered a dead body in the
trunk of a car on that block�the 6 had been able to smell the decomposing body just
two days after the murder.
When you have a 6-vibration child, you may find that they act as if he or she is the
parent, in charge of you. Don�t take it personally; just work with these children and
provide ways for them to use their nurturing qualities, such as getting a pet to take care
of. Life Path 6 children may not get the memo on the fact that you are older and wiser,
but they are dynamic and destined to do something great if you are supportive of them.
A perfect day for a 6 would be if the people in their life got on their knees and
said, �I�m not worthy.� Okay, maybe not quite that dramatic, but it�s true that 6s don�t
46
take criticism well. If you have a 6 in your life, you must find a way to compliment
them prior to offering constructive criticism. If the 6 is a child, you might say
something like, �Gee, your room looks really good. You�ve kept it clean and I�m
really proud of you.� Only then can you go on to the objective. If math is the problem,
say: �Could you please work on your math a little bit harder?� Because if you have
praised the child first, he�ll be more open to listening�and hearing�what you have
to say. (Actually, I would recommend this technique for all numbers.) There are some
numbers that verbally come right out with the negative that they are feeling and it hurts
people. I know that�s rarely deliberate. I really think most of us are trying to help each
other, and defensiveness is what gets in the way of true communication. If you put that
compliment first, it is the way to communicate because then others can really hear you.
When it comes to friendship, 6s tend to be loyal and trustworthy; if you confide in
them they will keep your secrets. The only time the 6 will betray your trust is if they
are living on the negative side of the number. The upside is that if a 6 does betray your
trust, and is confronted, they will feel worse than you do. The 6 will continue to ask
for forgiveness until you decide to let him or her back into your life. If you choose not
to forgive, the 6 will always carry the pain of having let you down. Betrayal is that
contrary to the essence of the 6 Life Path.
So to the 6 Life Path I would say to be careful not to give away confidential
information, as the act will have a boomerang effect on you. After all, as a 6 Life Path
you very much need to have people respect your privacy�confidentiality means a
great deal to you. Remember The Golden Rule and do unto others as you would have
them do unto you.
Occupations that work for the 6 include interior decorator, real estate agent,
guidance counselor, academic adviser, and greeting card designer. They also excel as
hair and makeup artists. Many 6s are creatively gifted, and if that�s true for you, you
should rejoice and be sure to work with it. We find many 6s acting and making music,
whether by playing an instrument or singing.
There is only so much room a person can give in a relationship�and the 6 Life
Path often tries to push that limit by giving too much. The result is that the 6 puts
people on a pedestal. Unfortunately, anyone who�s up on a pedestal is bound to fall at
one time or another. Next thing you know, 6s feel betrayed and will often begin to see
themselves as martyrs. One of the great talents of the 6 is the ability to make others
feel very guilty.
Once the 6 believes they are carrying most of the burden in a relationship, they�ll
break it off abruptly�and leave their partner wondering what went wrong. For this
reason 6s can�t wait too long before they speak up. I would caution the 6 to keep
communication open before things go terribly wrong. The sudden anger you can
47
display will come as a huge surprise to the recipient, and often can mean the downfall
of the relationship. When a 6 is unhappy, no one in the room is happy. Everyone
around the table feels a little bit sick as they eat the turkey that the unhappy 6 just
cooked.
What is interesting about a 6 is that people usually sense a compasssionate
personality, but if the 6 decides they do not like you, or if they�re not comfortable in a
setting, they can put up an air that is so cold, it will chill the most thick-skinned
person. This is the kind of power a 6 has. And the 6 always has an opinion.
A 6 Life Path believes that �if you want something done, you have to do it
yourself.� They don�t just do their own job, but also try to do everyone else�s! The 6
vibrations feel they are working too hard, and yet that hard work makes them feel
indispensable. They have to learn to step back and trust that people can do their own
jobs and that the work will get done. Otherwise their intense efforts can backfire, with
others feeling resentful. So what I say is, �Relax, 6 Life Path, you are a powerful
number and you don�t have to try so hard.�
