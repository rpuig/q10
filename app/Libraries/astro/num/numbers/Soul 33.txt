MASTER SOUL URGE 33/6
You have a deep need to become a  masterful healer and inspired visionary.

When you look deep into your core, you have an underlying and pressing need to become �The Cosmic Parent� (to quote Numerologist Michelle Buchanan).

If you find yourself with a 33/6 Soul Urge number, your mission is to be a Master Healer and to bring forth a higher form of love to the world.  Since you have the double 3�s, you also have to do this with joy, fun, and heart-felt communication and expression.

Some of your internal struggles might include feeling intensely over-burdened.  Your tendency will be to be emotionally raw, taking in the wounds of the world.  Even so, you�re still on the path of helping and healing in whatever form you choose.

Control and perfectionism will need to be overcome in order to fulfill your heart�s desire.  Since the energy of the 33 is quite intense, chances of succumbing to its destructive tendencies are fairly high.  What are those tendencies?  Avoidance through addiction.  Self-absorption to the point of abject Narcissism.  Mental and emotional melt-downs.  When you attempt to carry the entire world on your shoulders, something�s gotta give!

It�s your calling to teach and show by example the power of unconditional love.  You�re meant to serve as a conduit to healing on whatever level you feel most compelled to engage.  The Master number presupposes that you�ll take on leadership positions in the areas of loving service and the 33/6passcompasses visionary goals, truth and beauty, and a nurturing and giving heart.
