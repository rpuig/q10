The �9� Life Path: The Humanitarian
The positive thinker sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves
the impossible.
�ANONYMOUS
The 9 is the most evolved number in Numerology, and is considered one of the
strongest of all the Vibrations because it contains the qualities of all the other
numbers. When a 9 has a strong spiritual base, they are a wonderful source of light in
the world. Indeed, there is a selfless quality to the 9. It�s also the highest of the single
vibrations and is ruled by determination. This Life Path has a strong inclination to
follow something believed in, and they will pursue it with tremendous ambition and
drive. As a result, there will always be people who are jealous and resentful of the 9.
I suggest that the 9s follow the old adage: �Keep your friends close, and your enemies
closer.� The 9 needs to be aware of those trying to sabotage their plans, and make an
effort to put this kind of person at ease. Some people will see you as condescending
and you need to be aware of this fact before you speak.
It is really upsetting to the 9 Life Path to work hard for something and then it
doesn�t come to fruition. The 9s have an authentic regard for humanity, so their goals
usually serve others well. When 9s fail, they feel they�ve failed the world. One of the
strongest characteristics of 9 Life Paths is that they often have issues with their
original family. They may feel unloved or abandoned by their mother or father, or they
may feel completely responsible for their parents. Either way, the 9�s attachment to
her original family is hard to give up.
When they marry and start their own family, 9s want nothing less than to be the
�perfect parent.� Of course there is no such thing as a perfect parent�or a perfect
child. Children come through us, but we do not own them. They are here to teach us
something, and we are here to teach them. I say 9s need to go easy on themselves and
not take life so hard, lest they feel like failures when something goes wrong with their
kids�which we all know will happen at some point or another.
When it comes to the family, the 9 cannot handle interference. If having trouble
with their partners, they don�t want their parents or siblings to get involved. The 9
feels capable of resolving the situation�and since the 9 is the number of completion,
that�s probably right. The answers come to 9 Life Paths when they engage their
spiritual side and listen to the inner voice.
The 9 Life Paths do so much and take such good care of everybody�s business that
when they are in trouble, people don�t even notice. People look at a 9 and think: Oh,
59
he�s so strong, he doesn�t need my help. I always tell 9s to let their guards down a bit
more, to ask for a hug or a kiss when they need one. They�re not a Life Path whose
needs are easily read by others�they have to ask.
The 9s don�t need to be the center of attention, but people put them there anyway.
If a 9 Vibration is standing in a department store, everyone assumes that person works
there. If a 9 walks into a classroom, people ask, �Are you the teacher?� They just
assume the 9 is in charge, and that�s why the 9 should be in charge�because 9s don�t
abuse the privilege. They are not rude to those who are under their authority. No
matter what they set their minds on, or whether they�ve ever done it before, the 9 will
manage to pull it off. Things just seem to work out for the 9. Ironically, 9 Life Paths
are the only ones who don�t see this! They�re very hard on themselves, and even if
they do a good job, they will beat themselves up if it wasn�t perfect. I think 9s need to
lighten up and forgive themselves for being human.
There is, on the other hand, a really intimidating quality to the 9. Sometimes
people will be jealous of or competitive with the 9, yet the 9s compete with no one.
They are simply doing the best they can. I believe it�s actually the 9�s job to put others
at ease. It�s as simple as the 9 remembering to say, �Hey, I really like your haircut,�
or, �Gee, what a nice suit.� These simple words will disarm people who would
otherwise see the 9 as an enemy.
The 9 Life Path is often accused of being patronizing. They may not think that they
know everything, but others view them as feeling that way. This breeds resentment and
competition in those around the 9 vibration. It�s a hard lesson to learn, but 9s must
understand that on some subconscious level people can feel the 9 is on a higher
vibration. The 9 Life Paths must remind themselves, �Forgive them, for they know not
what they do.�
If a 9 does something good, people follow. If a 9 does something bad, people also
follow. They make amazing teachers, school counselors, and therapists. They�re really
good with children, and children tend to love them. They�re excellent doctors, nurses,
and social workers. They do well in creative fields as lecturers, artists, illustrators,
and writers, and perform as musicians and actors.
My most important piece of advice for 9 Life Paths is to take care not to live in the
passt. When they get into the moment, they can make a positive difference in this world
�and that, after all, is what the 9 is here to do.
