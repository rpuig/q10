MASTER SOUL URGE NUMBER  22/4
You have a deep need to bring forth masterful teaching and inspired practical ideas.

When you look deep into your core, you have an underlying and pressing need to execute and build projects that will benefit a wide arena of humankind.  This is a spiritual path (like all the Master numbers) that prods you to step out of the slow, steady security of the number Four and kick it up substantially.

This will be uncomfortable for you until you get the hang of it, because it’s contrary to the pull you have with the rule-following energy of the 4.

You’ll use all the hardworking, step-by-step qualities of the 4 while tapping into a higher level of purpose and action.  You’ll learn to take risks and look toward setting higher stakes with your enterprises.

You’re the Master Builder extraordinaire, so look toward building solid foundations to your enterprise with the big picture in front of you at all times.

Some of your internal struggles might include not feeling up to the task or even entitled to do something that might take you into fame and fortune.  You might even cringe at the idea of making a lot of money given the energy of the Four is more about feeling a sense of security, not necessarily manifesting abundance.  It sounds like a small detail, yet mentally this can drag you down.

Deep down at your core, you’re being pushed toward bringing spiritual practices down to the material, day-to-day world.  Avoid your stubborn streak and a tendency to be a know-it-all.  Gather your supporters around you, set up the systems to make it work, and hand over some of the responsibilities to others.  If you find yourself doing it all yourself, you aren’t living up to your 22/4 Soul Urge.
