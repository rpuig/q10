The �7� Life Path: The Faith Seeker
There does, in fact, appear to be a plan.
�ALBERT EINSTEIN
The 7 Life Path is here to learn to have faith. If 7s don�t have faith in their lives,
they can�t truly be happy. This doesn�t necessarily mean they�re going to be into
organized religion�faith comes in different packages. But there is undeniably a
spiritual energy surrounding the 7. If you have a 7 child, you�ll notice when he or she
sleeps that you seem to be looking at an angel. Luckily for those of us with 7s in our
lives, they often continue to exude that beautiful spirit even when they become adults.
I honestly believe there are two kinds of people on our planet: those who thank
God, and those who think they�re God. This is true for the 7 more than any other
number. The 7 needs a strong spiritual base. If the 7s don�t believe in a higher power,
or if they question the meaning of life, they�ll be exhausting to have around. They will
also try to escape: When they�re off track, 7s, like the 5s, are drawn to drugs, alcohol,
sex, travel, and overwork.
I often make the joke that 7s are just visiting the planet, because they don�t seem to
be from here. I think 7s are here observing humans, not quite sure what makes us tick.
As a matter of fact, in any given year you�ll find a surprising number of Oscarnominated
directors�those who turn life into art�who are 7 Life Paths. The 7 is also
a great number for philosophers. It�s no accident that Leonard Nimoy, who played
Spock in Star Trek, is a 7 Life Path.
The number 7 is considered a magic number in many cultures, both ancient and
modern. People who are 7s tend to have a natural psychic ability, and it�s important
for them to take alone time to regroup. The ability to see beyond the normal range can
be a burden, but meditation can help the 7 use this ability wisely. The 7�s biggest
spiritual breakthroughs usually come when they are by themselves, and alone with
nature. As Pythagoras said, �Those who desire wisdom should look for it in solitude.�
In the Hebrew Bible�or the Old Testament�the scripture tells us that on the
seventh day God rested. Mankind was then enjoined to rest on the seventh day as well.
The Orthodox Jews keep very closely to this tradition�not even lighting a fire on the
Sabbath.
In healthy, loving relationships, the 7 tends to be completely loyal, honest, and
direct. In spite of this, Life Path 7s sometimes have trouble saying, �I love you,� or
praising their partner. This comes from a fear that their loved ones might realize
50
they�re too good for them and leave. The irony is that if the person does leave it�s
often because of feeling undervalued and neglected.
On the other hand, it�s very obvious when the 7 doesn�t like you because they�ll
tell you�and it�s not a fun experience, since 7s have lethal tongues. They also have
what I call a mental steel door. If 7s decide they don�t want you in their lives, they�ll
shut that door and that�ll be the end of the relationship.
The 7 loves natural beauty. Rivers, oceans, lakes�anything connected to water
helps the 7 get out of his own head. This is important, since 7s tend to think too much.
They also love mountains, the snow, flowers, plants, and green grass. They have a
wonderful affinity for the simple things. Since they�re not always good at
understanding people�s needs and wants, they often crave the unconditional love that
comes from having pets.
The 7 is a very bright, intelligent, and intense number. Much like the Life Path 4,
the 7 will overanalyze every situation. They�ll walk into a room and see all of the
details right away. (As a result, 7s tend to be very good writers.) They also become
computer experts and scientists�anything involving technical work. Life Path 7s are
good at discovering things. It would not be surprising if a 7 vibration finds the cure for
AIDS. They�re often able to solve difficult problems, but they may not know where the
answer came from. I believe this is a result of the fact that 7s living on the positive
side of their numbers are more closely linked with God than all the other Life Path
Numbers.
Interestingly, 7s like to have an air of secrecy and will do anything to keep the
mystery going. The more you pry or ask questions, the more the 7 shuts down. They are
exclusive. Even in a marriage it�s not uncommon for a 7 to sleep in a separate bed or
even in a separate room. This is meant as no offense to the spouse, the 7s just need
their own space. If you are in a relationship with a 7, don�t take it personally when
your partner becomes very quiet. The 7 needs time to assess and dissect all those
thoughts and ideas.
The 7 vibrations need to work hard too. Work is their passsion, and they�ll throw
themselves into it, because they feel like they can be in control in the working
environment. Life Path 7s make good psychologists and psychiatrists�anything to do
with the study of the mind. They have psychic ability, so they can excel at
Numerology, astrology, and tarot card reading. They are good public speakers. They
don�t seek it out, it comes to them: When they speak, people want to listen to them.
Other compatible occupations are those concerning the mysteries of nature:
oceanography, astronomy, biology, and geology.
I also like to say that the 7 has the Peter Pan syndrome. They are children for life
51
in many ways. Conversely, when they are children, their parents often point out that
they seem like old souls. When a young 7 says something that seems beyond their
years, don�t disregard it: 7s have tremendous wisdom and insight, so when a 7 child
tells you something, listen carefully. They have strong intuition and may see something
you don�t�and need to know.
The 7 can be misunderstood because often this vibration has a quality that makes
people feel judged in their presence. Others may feel the 7 is cold or aloof, but I can
tell you that the reason they might seem to be holding back is that they are simply
observing the world.
