The �3� Life Path: The Communicator
The best way to succeed in life is to act on the advice we give to others.
�ANONYMOUS
When Shakespeare wrote that �all the world�s a stage,� he was talking like a 3.
When on track, the 3 Life Path is always performing or taking center stage in some
way. The 3s love creativity, communication, and connecting with people. They are
often the entertainers of the world. They love being listened to, so you�ll often find
them on the phone. Writing is also a big deal to the 3, as it�s another form of
communication. Anything having to do with the written word is appealing to this
vibration.
In personal relationships, 3s can also be very romantic. They are fiercely loyal,
and they never truly get over their passt relationships. Even when the relationship ends,
for a 3 it�s never quite over.
When the 3 Life Paths aren�t expressing themselves creatively, they will manifest
some sort of drama. They sometimes embellish what�s going on to make their lives
seem more interesting. Watch a child who�s a 3 at their storytelling and you�ll notice
they always exaggerate. The same can be said for 3 vibration adults! If they use this
tendency in a positive way, channeling it into motivational speaking, singing, or acting,
they can keep it healthy.
The 3 Life Path needs people. When they go home to check their messages and
there are none, they can feel a real sense of rejection. In relationships, 3 Life Paths
don�t always see the situation for what it really is until they get burned. Since 3s are
natural counselors who see the potential in others, they often pick a partner who is a
�patient,� with the thought that they can save that person. This tendency often leads
them into depression. Everything is going great one minute and the next, BOOM! The 3
crash-lands. The 3 Life Paths have to guard against extreme highs and lows. They must
learn to control their emotions, and look for the middle ground.
A 3 Life Path makes an excellent salesperson. If a 3 believes in something, by the
time he or she is through with you, you will believe in it too. The 3s make great
entertainers, models, actors, designers, musicians, singers, comedians, and any type of
performer. They also shine in the worlds of cosmetology, hairdressing, fashion, and
jewelry design. The reason is simple: They want the world to look better. They take a
look at someone and say, �How can I make that person better-looking and special?�
These people are natural clowns. People who come to my mind are Bill Cosby,
Groucho Marx, and Tracey Ullman. These are the people who want to enjoy life, and
36
never quite grow up.
The creative 3 vibration doesn�t do well with the standard nine-to-five job, and
doesn�t like working under others. Their minds move very quickly and when someone
is slow thinking, it will frustrate the 3. At the same time, the 3 must guard against
becoming too domineering when they are in charge. If they are in a dead-end job or
lifestyle, they can get themselves caught in some pretty sticky situations that may be
hard to get out of. They have to use their creative gifts. They can seem manicdepressive,
experiencing intense mood swings if they�re not using their talents.
A 3 Life Path must be careful with whom they spend their time. They are warm and
giving by nature and tend to attract world-class takers. If 3s find that they are always
the giver in a relationship and there is no reciprocation, it will lead to bitterness. They
must learn to walk away from relationships that are unbalanced in this way.
Their strength of mind and sharp wit often put them ahead of the crowd. When the
3 Life Path is living on the positive side of its vibration, the 3 is clever, entertaining,
and makes for great company. They are a joy to be around. The 3s are known for their
trademark smile, bright eyes, and pleasant-sounding voice. If they are living on the
negative side of the vibration, they can spread gossip and have a very difficult time
keeping a secret. If you are a 3, learning to bite your tongue would be wise. One of the
gifts a 3 does possess is to take an adverse condition and flip it around to the benefit
of themselves and others. The 3s learn from adversity, intuitively understanding that
sometimes you have to go through the negative to get to the positive. The 3 Life Path
uses that fine sense of humor to get through the bad days. Laughter is what saves them.
If you are a 3 Life Path and you are reading this thinking, Wow, I�m not like that, I
don�t feel like I can express myself at all, this automatically tells me that you have
scars from your original family; that your parents, no matter how caring, did not give
you that round of applause that you so needed as a child. I strongly recommend that
you go to chapter 4 and do the affirmations for the number 3. It is important for you to
heal yourself so that you can be the person you were born to be. Trust that you can find
your way to effortless self-expression, and you will. It�s never too late!
