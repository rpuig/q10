The �5� Life Path: The Adventurer
Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off
your goals.
�ANONYMOUS
The 5 Life Path loves freedom, fun, and adventure. They love variety; they might
take a different route to work each day because they get bored so easily. This
vibration needs constant stimulation. They like passsion. Escape is the name of the 5�s
game; of all the Life Paths, 5s are the most likely to escape through sex, food, drugs,
alcohol, travel, or overwork.
The average 5 Life Path male does not get married early, and if they do, they often
get married more than once. The first marriage is often short-lived because they don�t
want to feel tied down. They need to feel it�s their world, and if a woman holds on too
tightly or is too needy, they feel smothered. This is also true for the 5 Life Path
woman. She cannot stand a man who clings to her. The woman�s message is very
simple: �Do not control me.� If you give your 5 sweetheart plenty of space he or she
will almost always come back to you.
This Life Path is all about the senses. Things must taste just right, smell good, look
pretty, and feel pleasing, or they�re not happy. This goes for their appearance as well:
The 5 likes to look attractive. In Numerology, 3s and 5s are similar in that they both
like to look �performance ready��hair, clothes, and makeup just perfect.
The 5s are also our natural detectives. They love to find out what happened, to be
in the know. If they think someone is being dishonest, they�ll do the research to find
out the truth. They don�t like feeling that they�re in the dark.
These people are the celebrators of life. The typical 5 loves Thanksgiving,
Christmas, Hanukkah, or any holiday they can find on the calendar. They like to make
every occasion beautiful and exciting. They�re also natural givers, and would rather
give the perfect gift than receive it. I often say that if a 5 received a thank-you note, the
5 would write a thank you for the thank you! The 5s are also known for their great
penmanship and are experts at leaving messages on your answering machine that make
you want to call them back. They give just enough information to pique your curiosity.
When it comes to career, 5s make good photojournalists, pilots, flight attendants,
travel agents, tour guides, cruise directors�anything to do with travel. I doubt there�s
a 5 on this planet who wouldn�t enter a drawing for a free plane ticket. They�re
always making plans to go to Europe or somewhere tropical and exciting.

It is important that the 5s venture out and live their quest, be it taking a career they
love or traveling all over the world. If they aren�t making use of their energy and
drive, life can easily turn into a soap opera. This false drama can lead to depression
and a martyr complex. If you know a 5 Life Path who feels their life is not their own,
you already know that they can become champion complainers.
The adventuresome 5 is often entrepreneurial and doesn�t like to be subject to
someone else�s authority. Since 5s have a natural gift for entertaining, you�ll often find
them in the hospitality industry. A good profession for the 5 is wedding planning and
decorating.
At the same time, there�s a wild side to the 5, because they would rather be dead
than bored. It�s no surprise that you�ll often find 5s in the charts of rock stars,
strippers, and casino owners. I�ve yet to meet a 5 whose life was not fascinating and
who didn�t have more than enough stories for just one lifetime. The 5s are also
gamblers. If not risking actual money at the table, they are taking chances in life.
They are compasssionate. Any 5 who sees a homeless man wants to know his story.
When they see an injustice, they can�t help but be affected by it even if it has nothing to
do with them personally.
A lot of 5s escape in books. When they read books, they live vicariously through
them. Of course, that can be a safe and healthy form of escape. I have also found that
5s make wonderful fiction writers because their imagination is so vivid. When you
pick up a book written by a 5 Life Path, you will fall into this imaginary world that
they have created, and when the story is over, you will be very eager for their next
novel. J. K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter novel series, is a 5 Life Path�
need I say more? As you can see, escape is the name of their game. If you yell at a 5,
the 5 will not listen. A 5 will tune you out. They might shake their head and nod
agreeably, but truthfully, they have mentally left the building.
The 5 is restless and has to keep moving. They are quick to jump in and out of
relationships, and can be lured away from their partners by the promise of more
passsion and sex elsewhere. I caution my clients to beware of letting go of a healthy
relationship too soon; often 5s will leave a marriage and years later realize it was the
best relationship they�d ever had.
People with this Life Path have to live their lives and have fun and experience the
variety life has to offer. If you�re involved with a 5, my advice is to avoid the
temptation to cling too tightly. If your 5 is in a job that requires that he or she has to
leave you from time to time, just let go. You don�t need to feel threatened; just trust
that you are loved. And when your 5 comes back, you�ll have more love and
appreciation than ever before.
