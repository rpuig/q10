Business group: 2,4,8

In my experience, this means the 2 is in the business of love; the 4 is in the
business of security, building their foundation; and the 8 is in the business of
establishing financial freedom and doing things on a grand scale. When the 2 lives on
the positive side of its vibration, it has more understanding and empathy than any other
number. 

They do want to be friends with everyone. My other observation of a 2 is that
they are the ones who always recommend someone who can help you. For instance, if
your back hurts, they’ll say, “Oh, I know a chiropractor who would be good for you.”
Or if you’re out of a job: “I know someone who’s looking for someone to help them
with their business.” 

The 2s are constantly trying to refer someone to someone else.
Notice how that’s not competitive? They’re just trying to help, to make the world a
better place.
